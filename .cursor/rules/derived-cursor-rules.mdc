## AI Coding Assistant Rules

## TECH STACK

- VitePress
- Tailwind CSS
- Vue.js
- TypeScript


## PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM

- All interactions with the AI coding assistant are logged and versioned.  
- Version updates are noted in relevant sections (e.g., TECH STACK,  PROJECT DOCUMENTATION & CONTEXT SYSTEM).
-  Commit messages should clearly describe changes made.

## CODING STANDARDS

- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables).
- Write clean, well-documented code.
- Follow Tailwind CSS best practices.  Dark mode support should be included for all components.  Colors should be defined using Tailwind classes wherever possible.  Avoid hardcoding colors unless absolutely necessary.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety.
-  All SVG icons should use `currentColor` for fill color to inherit parent element's color.  Avoid hardcoding colors within SVGs.

## WORKFLOW & RELEASE RULES

- All changes must be thoroughly tested before deployment.
-  Commit frequently with clear messages.
- New features must be accompanied by comprehensive documentation.

## DEBUGGING

- Use browser developer tools for debugging.
- Utilize console logging for troubleshooting.


## BEST PRACTICES

- Prioritize code readability and maintainability.
-  Use version control (Git) effectively.
-  Always test thoroughly before merging changes.
-  Leverage Tailwind's dark mode features (`darkMode: 'class'`) for efficient theme switching.


##  UI/UX GUIDELINES

-  Maintain visual consistency across the application.
-  Ensure accessibility for all users.
-  Headers should include a subtle shadow (`shadow-sm`) in light mode and no shadow (`dark:shadow-none`) in dark mode.
- List items should use a subtle background color to create visual separation (e.g., `bg-gray-50` for light mode, `dark:bg-neutral-800` for dark mode).


##  CONFLICT RESOLUTION

- If a new rule conflicts with an existing one, the conflict will be noted, and either resolved by clarifying the final rule or flagged for user confirmation.
